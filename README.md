# Traffic Simulation Project

Contents:
brain - we will put our simulation here with traffic logic, and then expand it into a brain that can interact with the arduino side
cars - we will put our car's movement logic here, like speed, how to turn wheels, whether to park
hardware - just a dump for schematics or any wiring/breadboarding setups
docs - document our changes, we can translate this into a really nice readme after we are done with this project.
