A* algorithm for car pathfinding
map nodes and drawing via pygame
car logic, with perfect turning now and driving on LHS of road
main accepts multiple nodes as a path, and the car should ideally path find through the whole set of nodes.
restricted cars to NO 180 degree turns (i.e no turning on the spot)
change letter based nodes to number based nodes for future expansions so we aren't constricted by a 26 letter node
and reviewed AI stuff... shouldnt be any bugs its okay to have bugs early on
!!! TODO in next few days: implement a 2nd car + traffic rules, see if we can tell the car where to go in real time also !!!

- added guide rails (will turn them invisible later on but im keeping them on for debugging). These guide rails make the car's turning MUCH MUCH cleaner than before
- The guide rails exist under path_manager.py and this can be expanded for other maps.
- Added traffic lights with visual cues so user can see which roads can go and which must stop. Cars respect these rules
- Tweaked the collision detection system a little using bounding boxes. (made the boxes visible) and made it smarter
- Some tweaks to the map itself, made the roads longer.
- Added three modes that can be toggled with 1/2/3.  Debug MODE: See all rails and bounding boxes + All below, Info Mode: See the destination node of car + Time until traffic light turns green, Clean Mode: See nothing
- Added a global cooldown time for traffic lights so that existing turning traffic can clear before a new green light is lit.

- made the map smart. we can now define a grid and which nodes will exist, and the cars will dynamically be smart to the new map.
- added a yellow light system so that if cars are close enough to the line before the light turns red, the car will just go anyway to prevent edge cases where cars stop on the line itself which bugs out the system.
- make cars stop more compactly to fit more of em in the grid
- made car size dynamic to map size (more nodes in same screen -> roads are smaller -> we need cars to be smaller to fit on roads). accordingly, the car speed, stopping distance, (anything related to distance) is also scaled.
- added more colors and more max cars to stress test the simultaneous logic
- added different car types like trucks and vans with different properties
- added deconflict logic when max cars > max nodes, causing cars to spawn on the same node, causing a deadlock from the getgo
- fixed a few bugs, added a few bugs
- simplified collision logic so hard that it basically assumes drivers are dumb (only look ahead for 1 car length etc, will explain more if need be)

- i tried adding acceleration but it is an incredibly buggy feature aand so i removed it (it broke basically everything above). need more time to figure out sometime later

- made the physics realistic, cars now follow a new physics system inspired by csgo, where new vel = decay vel + engine - friction
- a car is now in one of either 3 states: accelerate, cruise, brake
- added different coloured hitbox mode depending on state car is in
- cars will now calculate a cruise distance and brake distance when moving. This being the min distances travelled after cruising or braking respectively
- cars will compare these parameters to a respect distance to the next obstacle.
- similar to previous logic, if the next obstacle is a yellow light, it will see if it can meet the yellow light within the brake stop distance, else it will try to beat the light.
- complemeted vehicle types to reflect engine power, braking force, amongst other variables

potential bugs:
- cars crashing out of a turn, due to not being able to "see" the congestion. 
- no logic implemented if next segment is fully congested
